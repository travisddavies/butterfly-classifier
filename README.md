# Butterfly Classifier
This is a simple butterfly image classifier trained on 75 various species of
butterflies. The dataset was from Kaggle
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification).

Validation accuracy for the model is 0.85%, and runs for about 200 epochs, so
unless you have a good GPU it takes a while to train given that each image is
224x224 pixels.
